1. Review `plan.md` Iteration 3 tasks and existing design tokens in `docs/design/tailwind_tokens.md`.
2. Gather inspiration references and define mood, palette, typography, and motion principles.
3. Document layout wireframes, component states, and responsive breakpoints in `docs/design/ui_spec.md`.
4. Share the documented spec with stakeholders, collect feedback, and secure approval before coding.
5. Only after approval, begin implementation tasks that reference the approved spec, keeping the document updated with any revisions.
