## 4. Design Rationale & Trade-offs

<!-- anchor: key-decisions -->
### 4.1. Key Decisions Summary
- **Client-Only Execution:** Chosen to honor simplicity and privacy mandates; offloads scaling to Groq and browsers.
- **Multi-Phase Generation Pipeline:** Enables token efficiency, reliability, and magical UX without multiple user-visible steps.
- **IndexedDB-First Persistence:** Supports rich offline experiences and fast local reads/writes without backend costs.
- **Stencil-Based Export:** Guarantees robust web component output with Shadow DOM encapsulation for universal embedding.
- **CDN Runtime Dependencies:** Avoids bundling heavy libraries, ensuring previews match exported widgets.

<!-- anchor: alternatives-considered -->
### 4.2. Alternatives Considered
- **Server-Orchestrated Generation:** Rejected due to infrastructure overhead and key management complexity.
- **Single-Pass Code Generation:** Declined because it increases token costs and reduces success rates versus staged validation.
- **Centralized Database:** Unnecessary for early launch; client storage provides sufficient capabilities with fewer privacy concerns.
- **Only react-to-webcomponent Export:** Chosen as fallback; lacking advanced isolation compared to Stencil.

### 4.3. Known Risks & Mitigation
- **CDN Dependency Drift:** Mitigate via version pinning, integrity hashes, and monitoring of CDN availability.
- **Browser Storage Quotas:** Implement cleanup routines, compression, and export/import flows to manage space.
- **API Rate Limits:** Employ caching, exponential backoff, optional edge relay throttling, and user feedback on limits.
- **Client Performance Variance:** Offer graceful degradation (lighter templates), worker-based heavy tasks, and adjustable preview fidelity.

## 5. Future Considerations

<!-- anchor: potential-evolution -->
### 5.1. Potential Evolution
- Introduce collaborative real-time editing via WebRTC or CRDTs synchronized through optional backend relay.
- Expand template marketplace allowing community submissions vetted through automated validation pipelines.
- Integrate AI co-pilot for live code edits and guided debugging using streaming Groq models.
- Support multi-page app generation with router-aware previews and exports.

<!-- anchor: areas-for-deeper-dive -->
### 5.2. Areas for Deeper Dive
- Detailed security review of local key storage and sandbox protections.
- Performance profiling across devices to refine preview pipeline and caching strategies.
- Comprehensive testing strategy for exported bundles across desktop/mobile wrappers.
- Governance model for template library updates and versioning.

## 6. Glossary
- **Blueprint:** Lightweight plan describing component structure, data flows, and risks prior to full code generation.
- **Delta Prompt:** Minimal Groq request customizing template output based on blueprint insights.
- **Auto-Repair Pipeline:** Local validation and correction system ensuring generated code runs without full regeneration.
- **Universal Export:** Capability to package apps as web components, desktop, and mobile bundles from a single runtime manifest.
- **Shadow DOM:** Web component feature providing style encapsulation and predictable event handling.
